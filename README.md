# My Academic Engineering Journey

**This is a complication of my coding journey throughout my undergraduate and graduate engineering school courses.**

---

### Journey

1. Purdue University - Main Campus (West Lafayette) : Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering BS
2. Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta) : Computer Science and Engineering MS
3. Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta) : Aerospace Engineering PhD

### Code 

The code's are all from course assignments or course projects. The main languages are MATLAB, Python, C/C++, etc.
For those that have dedicated Github repositories, I have excluded from the code base.
