%% ____________________
%% INITIALIZATION

% Create seven (7) variables and set them equal to the values provided in 
% the problem setup: cone width, number of conical piles, windrow width,
% windrow length, number of windrow piles, angle of repose, and density of
% salt



%% ____________________
%% CALCULATIONS

% Convert salt density to (metric ton)/m^3 using the conversion constants:
% 1 kg = 2.2 lb, 1 mt = 1000 kg, 1 m = 3.3 ft 


% Calculate the height, volume, and weight of salt in a single conical pile 


% Calculate the height, volume, and weight of salt in a single windrow pile


% Calculate how much salt, in metric tons, can be stored in the specificed
% number of conical piles and windrow piles



%% ____________________
%% FORMATTED TEXT & FIGURE DISPLAYS

% Print the height and weight of one conical pile to the Command Window 
% using one print command. Use language appropriate for technical communication.
%   Display the height with 2 decimal place.
%   Display the weight with 1 decimal place.
%   Do not hardcode any values.
